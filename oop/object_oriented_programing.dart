 OOPS in Dart
 
 - Object-Oriented Programming is a programming methodlogy in which we use objects and their interactions to design and program applications.
 - oops is used in many popular programming languages like Java, C++, Python,Dart etc.
 
 Object has two main characteristics:
  1. Attributes | Properties | Fields (data members)
  2. Behavior | Functions (methods)

 Example:
   A car is an object. It has properties such as weight and color, and methods such as drive and brake.
   A person is an object. It has properties such as name and address, and methods such as eat and sleep.

   Advantages of OOPs:
      1. Easy to understand and use
      2. Reusability of code
      3. Decrease the complexity of the code
      4. Easy to maintain and modify and debug
      5. Increase the productivity of the programmer
      6. Pillars of OOPs


    Features of OOPs or Pillars of OOPs:
      1. Class and Object
      2. Abstraction
      3. Encapsulation
      4. Inheritance
      5. Polymorphism


     Main Purpose of OOPs:
       - The main purpose of OOPs is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.
       - This keeps the data safe and secure from outside interference and misuse.
       - This is called Data Hiding or Encapsulation.
       - To break complex problems into smaller parts and to represent them in the form of objects.
